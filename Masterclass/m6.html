                            <h1>How to Analyze Facebook Ads Data the Right Way</h1>
                            <p>In today’s video, I’m going to show you how to analyze Facebook ads data correctly. I’ll walk you through my exact dashboard column setup, how I analyze this data, and why metrics like CPM, CPC, and click-through rates aren’t as important in 2023. Let’s dive in!</p>
                            
                            <h2>Setting Up Your Facebook Ads Dashboard</h2>
                            <p>First, let’s take a look at my exact dashboard column setup. This setup is focused on delivering the most relevant data to guide my decision-making:</p>
                            
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Delivery, Bid Strategy, Attribution, Budget, and Amount Spent:</strong> These columns give you basic campaign performance data.</li>
                                <li><strong>Optimizing for Purchases:</strong> If you're working with e-commerce, track purchases and cost per purchase. If you’re optimizing for leads, include leads and cost per lead.</li>
                                <li><strong>Reach, Impressions, and Frequency:</strong> Frequency is a metric that’s often overlooked. It tells you whether you’re reaching new audiences or showing ads to the same people repeatedly. I recommend aiming for a frequency of 2 or under for prospecting and retargeting campaigns, and below 4 over the last 7 days for retargeting. Over 10 can indicate you're wasting money.</li>
                                <li><strong>CPM (Cost per 1000 Impressions):</strong> Monitor CPM as it gives you a general cost benchmark for your industry and creative performance.</li>
                                <li><strong>Hook Rate:</strong> The percentage of people who watch the first 3 seconds of your video ad. This is essential for understanding how engaging your ad is from the start.</li>
                                <li><strong>Hold Rate and Video Average Watch Time:</strong> Hold rate triggers when a viewer watches 15 seconds or more of a video. For videos under 15 seconds, hold rate measures complete video views. I cross-analyze this with average watch time to assess engagement.</li>
                                <li><strong>Unique Outbound Click-Through Rate:</strong> I prefer to use unique outbound CTR over link CTR, as it gives a purer indication of how many individual users are clicking through to the landing page.</li>
                                <li><strong>Landing Page Views, Leads, Checkouts, Shares, and Engagement:</strong> These are important metrics to see how users are interacting with your content beyond just clicking the ad.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <h2>How to Use This Dashboard Setup</h2>
                            <p>Now that we have our columns set up, let’s discuss how I use this dashboard to make decisions. I focus on two sets of KPIs:</p>
                            
                            <h3>Main KPIs</h3>
                            <p>These are the two most important KPIs I use to guide decisions:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Amount Spent:</strong> The amount spent on ads indicates which creatives are performing best. If a creative or ad set has the most spend, that’s what the algorithm tells me is working well.</li>
                                <li><strong>Purchases (or Leads):</strong> I always cross-check the amount spent with purchases or leads. I want to ensure the spend is driving the desired action, such as purchases for e-commerce or leads for lead gen campaigns.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>When reviewing this data, I typically look at the last 7 or 30 days. I identify which ads or creatives had the most purchases, then cross-reference that with the amount of spend. This helps me identify top performers. If a creative has high spend but low purchases, that’s a red flag and I dig deeper into the secondary KPIs.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Secondary KPIs (Storytelling Metrics)</h3>
                            <p>The secondary KPIs help me understand why a certain ad is working or not. These include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Hook Rate:</strong> If a creative has a high hook rate, that indicates it’s good at grabbing attention within the first few seconds of the video.</li>
                                <li><strong>Hold Rate and Video Average Watch Time:</strong> A high hold rate or video watch time means viewers are staying engaged with the content.</li>
                                <li><strong>Click-Through Rate:</strong> I look at click-through rate to compare which creatives are getting the most clicks, but I don’t use it as a benchmark for success—it's more of a secondary metric.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>These metrics give me a clearer picture of why a creative is performing well. For example, if a creative has a high hook rate, it’s likely grabbing attention early. I can use this data to create more engaging ads in the future.</p>
                            
                            <h2>Why CPM, CPC, and CTR Don’t Matter as Much in 2023</h2>
                            <p>Now, let’s talk about why CPM (Cost per 1000 Impressions), CPC (Cost per Click), and click-through rate aren’t the most important metrics to optimize for:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>CPM:</strong> While CPM is a useful benchmark, it’s often industry-dependent. For example, industries like finance have higher CPMs. It's better to use CPM as a storytelling metric to compare against your account’s baseline.</li>
                                <li><strong>CPC:</strong> CPC can be misleading, especially when working with broader audiences. Sometimes, a lower CPC can indicate less engagement, while a higher CPC might mean the ad is reaching a more targeted audience.</li>
                                <li><strong>Click-Through Rate:</strong> A lower CTR isn’t necessarily bad, especially when targeting broad audiences. Facebook's ad algorithm tends to be less effective with very specific audiences, which can lower CTR.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>The main takeaway is that these metrics should not drive decisions on their own. They should be compared against the broader trends within the ad account. For example, a high CPM doesn’t mean you should turn off an ad. Instead, assess it in context—maybe the ad is driving sales or engagement despite its higher CPM.</p>
                            
                            <h2>Looking Beyond the Numbers</h2>
                            <p>Some other non-metric factors I like to analyze are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Ad Comments:</strong> Often, the feedback in the comments can reveal why a creative is working or not. I always review ad comments when launching new tests to get insight directly from the audience.</li>
                                <li><strong>Organic Social Feedback:</strong> Sometimes, comments on your organic social posts (especially on platforms like TikTok) can provide valuable context about why an ad is performing well or poorly.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                            <p>In summary, while metrics like CPM, CPC, and click-through rates provide useful insights, they shouldn’t be the primary factors in your decision-making. Instead, focus on your main KPIs—spend and purchases—and use your secondary KPIs like hook rate, hold rate, and average watch time to understand why certain ads are performing well. Always dig into the data and feedback to make better decisions for your Facebook ad campaigns.</p>
